# CEO-Compensation-Analysis
# üìä CEO Compensation & Company Performance Analysis

## üìå Overview  
This project analyzes CEO compensation in relation to various company performance metrics. Using a dataset of **367 companies**, we investigate:  

- **What financial and market factors influence CEO pay?**  
- **Can we predict CEO total compensation using financial indicators?**  
- **How does debt structure relate to executive compensation?**  

This project was developed for **B DATA 200** by **Anushna Gunda, Inaya Rizvi, Harsh Malik, and Sai Bathina**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology  
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing  
- Handled missing values (median imputation for numeric variables, mode for categorical).  
- Converted negative values formatted as `(x.xx)` to `-x.xx`.  
- Renamed columns for consistency (`_` instead of spaces).  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Summary statistics for CEO pay and financial variables.  
- Visualizations (correlation heatmaps, scatter plots, box plots by industry).  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Regression Analysis  
- **Multiple Linear Regression** to assess which variables significantly predict CEO compensation.  
- **Stepwise Regression** to refine the model and remove weak predictors.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Clustering (Optional)  
- **K-Means Clustering** to group companies based on debt, profitability, and compensation patterns.
